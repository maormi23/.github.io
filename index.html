    <h3>Profile</h3>
    <p>
        I am a 24-year-old Information Systems student specializing in AI at the University of Haifa, currently in my second academic year.<br>
        My genuine passion for technology started early—since my teens, I independently managed dedicated servers and digital environments, which provided me with early, hands-on experience in system administration, web architecture, and data concepts like SQL.<br>
        Academically, I have completed introductory and Object-Oriented Programming courses, which included weekly labs and practical project development.<br>
        Currently, I work as an IT Support Specialist, where I gain valuable hands-on experience in a professional environment.<br>
        I actively apply my programming skills, primarily in Python, to automate processes and solve complex technical problems at work.<br>
        I am seeking a part-time position that combines my technical foundation, particularly in programming and systems, with opportunities for meaningful impact and continuous professional growth in the AI and Data fields.
